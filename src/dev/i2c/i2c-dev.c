/**
 * \file src/dev/i2c/i2c-dev.c I2C device driver
 *
 * \addtogroup i2c I2C module
 * \brief Universal I2C driver.
 * 
 * \section Unix Unix
 * This driver uses a file based unix interface. This means that all communication is done using
 * file I/O. The only differency is the opening of files. Normally the (f)open function is used for
 * this purpose, but in this case i2cdev_socket is used.
 * 
 * \section io I/O and error handling
 * <b>Master read/write</b>
 * When you want to do a master transfer, sent a repeated start and receive data from the slave
 * your I/O block will look like the following.
 * 
\code{.c}
struct i2c_client *client;
client = i2c_alloc_client(ATMEGA_I2C_C0_ADAPTER, 0x54, 100000UL);
i2c_set_callback(client, &master_callback); // call-back will set a second message
int fd;

fd = i2cdev_socket(client, _FDEV_SETUP_RW | I2C_MASTER);
if(fd < 0) {
    error();
    return;
}
i2c_set_transmission_layout(client, "wr"); // write read
write(fd, txbuff, txbuff_length);
read(fd, rxbuff, rxbuff_length);
mode(fd, _FDEV_SETUP_RW | I2C_MASTER | I2CDEV_CALL_BACK);
write(fd, txbuff2, txbuff2_length); // this msg will have a callback
flush(fd);
close(fd);
\endcode
 * 
 * Setting a buffer (<b>and its length</b>) to zero, will result in addressing only if not specified
 * by the bus. The transmit buffer will be set using <i>write</i> the receive buffer is set using 
 * <i>read</i>.
 * 
 * <b>Slave recieve/transmit</b>
\code{.c}
struct i2c_client *client;

client = i2c_alloc_client(ATMEGA_I2C_C0_ADAPTER, 0x54, 100000UL);
i2c_set_callback(client, &slave_callback); // call-back will set a second message

for(;;) {
	fd = i2cdev_socket(client, _FDEV_SETUP_RW | I2C_SLAVE | I2CDEV_CALL_BACK); // modes can be changed using mode(fd)
	if(fd < 0) {
		error();
		continue;
	}
	read(fd, &rx, rxlen);
	flush(fd);
	close(fd);
}
\endcode
 * 
 * If no master request is received, all messages are deleted on the next slave call.
 * 
 * \note Behaviour for clients acting as a master Ã¡nd slave at the same time is undefined. Altough
 *       it is possible to do master and slave transactions 'simutaniously' using seperate clients.
 * \note When setting the slave time-out to, for example, 500ms there should not be a master transaction
 *       every 500ms. Either of those waiting times should be slowed down or sped up (instead, a
 *       BermudaThreadSleep(10) can also be inserted).
